			<t>About</t>
			<p>About Inspired by their father John Martin who with - partners Motley, Viera and Eytle was among the first indigenous commercial gold miners at the turn of the century around 1920.
		<br><br>
		Demerara Supply was started in post independence Guyana by local businessmen and brothers Wilfred and Freson Martin of Charlestown Georgetown, Demerara, Guyana to provide import and export services for the newly independent country. Later under the management of Teddy Clarke the company expanded to the wholesale supply of cement, the local distribution of pipe and fittings for drinking and sewage, materials for paint and specialized paints for roads and logging equipment. As well as the export of wooden prefabricated houses and cut lumber. 
		<br><br>
		The company's early customers included Taylor Woodrow International, Ballast Nedam, Van Kessel, Guymine, The Guyana Water Authority and the Ministry of Works and early construction companies as Barima Construction, Natram Construction, Hack's and King and Sons. The company also represented National Steel of the United States, RAYMOND International, Vassallo Industries of Puerto Rico and many other international companies with projects, supply Chains or an interest in Guyana.
		<br><br>
		In the 1980's the company started operations in the USA under the Business and Industrial Consultants led by Jason Martin and Joy Martin expanded into the development of supply chain activities and the promotion of international private public partnerships and joint ventures between Guyana, US, Caribbean and Dutch companies and government in cooperation with Wilfred Martin in Guyana.
		<br><br>
		In the 1990' s, under the Chairmanship of Wilfred Martin now in New York and leadership of Guyanese Charles Monkou, Ian Jones and Jason Martin the organization morphed into MCCG the Management Consulting and Controls Group providing consulting to management, construction management, international trade and technical consulting and training to businesses, non profits and government agencies. MCCG provided services in Guyana under the directorship of Kelvin Saul and in Trinidad under Ingrid White Wilson to international companies.
		<br><br>
		MCCG is now MCCCGUSA/Arvo a full service company providing professional and Supply Chain services with a US focus on project management, commercial real estate services and management consulting and international services in food, mining, hospitality, health care and sector development by direct services and through the promotion of joint ventures and public private partnerships.
		<br><br>
		Returning to its roots Demerara Supply and Services is now headquartered again in Guyana with a focus on services, logistics, distribution and development along the whole supply chain with affiliate offices in Trinidad, New York, Miami, Houston, and London to service the mining and oil industries.
